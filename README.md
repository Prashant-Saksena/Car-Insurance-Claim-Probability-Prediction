# Car-Insurance-Claim-Probability-Prediction
PREDICTIVE MODEL â€“ CAR INSURANCE CLAIM PROBABILITY (BASED ON COMPREHENSIVE CAR POLICY FEATURES AND SAFETY RATINGS)

In this project, we are trying to predict the probability of claiming car insurance by a customer of a car insurance company, based on historical trends in insurance claimed by customers and information about insured customers & their car features.

The objective would be to understand the factors that influence claim frequency and severity in six months and enable insurance companies to assess risk better and determine appropriate premiums for policyholders.

Attaching a presentation file and the project files to thoroughly describe the process of determining the prediction.
